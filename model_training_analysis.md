# Comprehensive Model Training Analysis

## Executive Summary

This document provides a deep analysis of training strategies for the Combined Cycle Power Plant linear regression models. Based on thorough data examination and preprocessing results, we outline critical considerations for both SGD and OLS model training to achieve optimal performance while maintaining statistical rigor.

## Dataset Characteristics and Training Implications

### Data Profile
- **Size**: 9,527 clean samples after duplicate removal
- **Features**: 4 numerical features (ambient_temp, vacuum, ambient_pressure, relative_humidity)
- **Target**: power_output (continuous regression)
- **Quality**: No missing values, industrially consistent data

### Critical Training Challenges

#### 1. Scale Disparities
- ambient_temp: 1.81 - 37.11°C
- vacuum: 25.36 - 81.56 cm Hg
- ambient_pressure: 992.89 - 1033.30 millibar
- relative_humidity: 25.56 - 100.16%

**Impact**: Without standardization, pressure values (~1000s) will completely dominate gradient calculations in SGD, leading to poor convergence.

#### 2. Feature Correlations and Multicollinearity
- ambient_temp ↔ vacuum: 0.844 (HIGH - problematic for OLS)
- ambient_temp ↔ power_output: -0.948 (very strong predictor)
- vacuum ↔ power_output: -0.870 (strong predictor)

**Impact**: High correlation between predictors creates multicollinearity issues for OLS interpretation and coefficient stability.

#### 3. Non-Normal Distributions
All variables fail Shapiro-Wilk normality tests (p < 0.05). This is expected for industrial data with operational constraints.

**Impact**: Affects OLS residual assumptions but doesn't invalidate the model if other assumptions hold.

## SGD Training Strategy

### Critical Requirements

#### 1. Mandatory Standardization
```python
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_standardized = scaler.fit_transform(X)
```
**Rationale**: SGD is extremely sensitive to feature scales. Without standardization:
- Pressure gradient components will be ~1000x larger than temperature
- Learning rate optimization becomes impossible
- Convergence will be slow or fail entirely

#### 2. Hyperparameter Grid Search
**Core Parameters**:
- `learning_rate`: ['constant', 'optimal', 'adaptive']
  - 'adaptive' likely optimal for this dataset's characteristics
- `penalty`: ['l2', 'l1', 'elasticnet']
  - ElasticNet recommended to handle multicollinearity
- `alpha`: [0.001, 0.01, 0.1]
  - Regularization strength tuning
- `eta0`: [0.001, 0.01, 0.1]
  - Initial learning rate for 'constant' and 'adaptive'

**Total Combinations**: 3 × 3 × 3 × 3 = 81 combinations

#### 3. Validation Strategy
- **3-fold cross-validation** for each parameter combination
- **Total experiments**: 81 × 3 = 243 model fits
- **Metrics**: R², RMSE, MAE for comprehensive evaluation

### Expected Challenges
1. **Convergence sensitivity** due to high feature correlations
2. **Learning rate optimization** requiring careful tuning
3. **Regularization balance** between bias and variance

## OLS Training Strategy

### Feature Selection Priority

Based on preprocessing analysis, 5 trustworthy feature combinations identified:

1. **High Performance**: ['ambient_temp', 'vacuum', 'relative_humidity']
   - R² ≈ 0.928, VIF = 4.88 (borderline acceptable)
2. **Most Stable**: ['ambient_temp', 'ambient_pressure', 'relative_humidity']
   - R² ≈ 0.921, VIF = 2.01 (excellent)
3. **Simple Strong**: ['ambient_temp', 'relative_humidity']
   - R² ≈ 0.920, VIF = 1.41 (excellent)
4. **Balanced**: ['ambient_temp', 'vacuum', 'ambient_pressure']
   - R² ≈ 0.918, VIF = 3.81 (good)
5. **Temp-Vacuum**: ['ambient_temp', 'vacuum']
   - R² ≈ 0.915, VIF = 3.41 (good)

### Statistical Diagnostic Requirements

#### 1. Multicollinearity Assessment
- **VIF < 5**: Acceptable for practical interpretation
- **Condition Number < 30**: Numerical stability threshold
- **All p-values < 0.05**: Statistical significance requirement

#### 2. Residual Analysis
- **Jarque-Bera test**: Residual normality
- **Breusch-Pagan test**: Heteroscedasticity detection
- **Durbin-Watson test**: Autocorrelation assessment

#### 3. Model Selection Criteria
- **AIC/BIC comparison**: Information criteria for model comparison
- **Adjusted R²**: Penalty for additional parameters

### Validation Strategy
- **3-fold cross-validation** for each feature combination
- **Performance stability** assessment across folds
- **Coefficient consistency** analysis

## Model Comparison Framework

### Performance Metrics
1. **R² Score**: Explained variance (primary metric)
2. **RMSE**: Root mean squared error (interpretable units)
3. **MAE**: Mean absolute error (robust to outliers)

### Model Selection Criteria

#### For SGD:
- **Cross-validation R²** (40%)
- **Parameter stability** across folds (30%)
- **Convergence reliability** (20%)
- **Computational efficiency** (10%)

#### For OLS:
- **Statistical validity** (VIF, p-values, diagnostics) (40%)
- **Cross-validation R²** (30%)
- **Coefficient interpretability** (20%)
- **Model parsimony** (AIC penalty) (10%)

## Implementation Priorities

### Phase 1: Data Preparation
1. Ensure standardization pipeline is robust
2. Implement 3-fold CV framework
3. Set up comprehensive logging system

### Phase 2: SGD Implementation
1. Grid search with early stopping

2. **Statistical validation** for OLS trustworthiness
3. **Systematic experimentation** with comprehensive logging
4. **Cross-validation consistency** for reliable performance estimates
5. **Clear interpretation** of model diagnostics and coefficients

## Expected Outcomes

- Interpretable coefficient estimates
- Comprehensive diagnostic validation

### Overall:
- Model comparison with clear recommendations
- Performance vs. interpretability trade-offs
- Statistical rigor throughout the analysis
