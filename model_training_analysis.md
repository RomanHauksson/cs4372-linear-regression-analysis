# Comprehensive Model Training Analysis

## Executive Summary

This document provides a deep analysis of training strategies for the Combined Cycle Power Plant linear regression models. Based on thorough data examination and preprocessing results, we outline critical considerations for both SGD and OLS model training to achieve optimal performance while maintaining statistical rigor.

## Dataset Characteristics and Training Implications

### Data Profile
- **Size**: 9,527 clean samples after duplicate removal
- **Features**: 4 numerical features (ambient_temp, vacuum, ambient_pressure, relative_humidity)
- **Target**: power_output (continuous regression)
- **Quality**: No missing values, industrially consistent data

### Critical Training Challenges

#### 1. Scale Disparities
- ambient_temp: 1.81 - 37.11°C
- vacuum: 25.36 - 81.56 cm Hg
- ambient_pressure: 992.89 - 1033.30 millibar
- relative_humidity: 25.56 - 100.16%

**Impact**: Without standardization, pressure values (~1000s) will completely dominate gradient calculations in SGD, leading to poor convergence.

#### 2. Feature Correlations and Multicollinearity
- ambient_temp ↔ vacuum: 0.844 (HIGH - problematic for OLS)
- ambient_temp ↔ power_output: -0.948 (very strong predictor)
- vacuum ↔ power_output: -0.870 (strong predictor)

**Impact**: High correlation between predictors creates multicollinearity issues for OLS interpretation and coefficient stability.

#### 3. Non-Normal Distributions
All variables fail Shapiro-Wilk normality tests (p < 0.05). This is expected for industrial data with operational constraints.

**Impact**: Affects OLS residual assumptions but doesn't invalidate the model if other assumptions hold.

## SGD Training Strategy

### Critical Requirements

#### 1. Mandatory Standardization
```python
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_standardized = scaler.fit_transform(X)
```
**Rationale**: SGD is extremely sensitive to feature scales. Without standardization:
- Pressure gradient components will be ~1000x larger than temperature
- Learning rate optimization becomes impossible
- Convergence will be slow or fail entirely

#### 2. Hyperparameter Grid Search
**Core Parameters**:
- `learning_rate`: ['constant', 'optimal', 'adaptive']
  - 'adaptive' likely optimal for this dataset's characteristics
- `penalty`: ['l2', 'l1', 'elasticnet']
  - ElasticNet recommended to handle multicollinearity
- `alpha`: [0.001, 0.01, 0.1]
  - Regularization strength tuning
- `eta0`: [0.001, 0.01, 0.1]
  - Initial learning rate for 'constant' and 'adaptive'

**Total Combinations**: 3 × 3 × 3 × 3 = 81 combinations

#### 3. Validation Strategy
- **3-fold cross-validation** for each parameter combination
- **Total experiments**: 81 × 3 = 243 model fits
- **Metrics**: R², RMSE, MAE for comprehensive evaluation

### Expected Challenges
1. **Convergence sensitivity** due to high feature correlations
2. **Learning rate optimization** requiring careful tuning
3. **Regularization balance** between bias and variance

## OLS Training Strategy

### Feature Selection Priority

Based on preprocessing analysis, 5 trustworthy feature combinations identified:

1. **High Performance**: ['ambient_temp', 'vacuum', 'relative_humidity']
   - R² ≈ 0.928, VIF = 4.88 (borderline acceptable)
2. **Most Stable**: ['ambient_temp', 'ambient_pressure', 'relative_humidity']
   - R² ≈ 0.921, VIF = 2.01 (excellent)
3. **Simple Strong**: ['ambient_temp', 'relative_humidity']
   - R² ≈ 0.920, VIF = 1.41 (excellent)
4. **Balanced**: ['ambient_temp', 'vacuum', 'ambient_pressure']
   - R² ≈ 0.918, VIF = 3.81 (good)
5. **Temp-Vacuum**: ['ambient_temp', 'vacuum']
   - R² ≈ 0.915, VIF = 3.41 (good)

### Statistical Diagnostic Requirements

#### 1. Multicollinearity Assessment
- **VIF < 5**: Acceptable for practical interpretation
- **Condition Number < 30**: Numerical stability threshold
- **All p-values < 0.05**: Statistical significance requirement

#### 2. Residual Analysis
- **Jarque-Bera test**: Residual normality
- **Breusch-Pagan test**: Heteroscedasticity detection
- **Durbin-Watson test**: Autocorrelation assessment

#### 3. Model Selection Criteria
- **AIC/BIC comparison**: Information criteria for model comparison
- **Adjusted R²**: Penalty for additional parameters

### Validation Strategy
- **3-fold cross-validation** for each feature combination
- **Performance stability** assessment across folds
- **Coefficient consistency** analysis

## Model Comparison Framework

### Performance Metrics
1. **R² Score**: Explained variance (primary metric)
2. **RMSE**: Root mean squared error (interpretable units)
3. **MAE**: Mean absolute error (robust to outliers)

### Model Selection Criteria

#### For SGD:
- **Cross-validation R²** (40%)
- **Parameter stability** across folds (30%)
- **Convergence reliability** (20%)
- **Computational efficiency** (10%)

#### For OLS:
- **Statistical validity** (VIF, p-values, diagnostics) (40%)
- **Cross-validation R²** (30%)
- **Coefficient interpretability** (20%)
- **Model parsimony** (AIC penalty) (10%)


### Deep Understanding: OLS for Power Plant Analysis

1. What OLS Actually Does (The Big Picture)

Ordinary Least Squares finds the best linear relationship between power plant
operating conditions and electrical output:

Power Output = β₀ + β₁(Temperature) + β₂(Vacuum) + β₃(Pressure) + β₄(Humidity) + ε

The Goal: Understand how much each operating condition affects power generation and       
why.

2. Key Assignment Requirements & Their Meaning

From Instructions: "Interpret ALL diagnostics"

The assignment emphasizes interpretation over computation. You need to explain what       
each number means for power plant operations.

3. OLS Statistical Diagnostics Explained

A. Coefficients (β values)

What: The actual effect size of each variable
Power Plant Meaning:
- β₁ = -14.7 → Every 1°C increase in temperature decreases power output by 14.7 MW        
- β₂ = +5.2 → Every 1 cm Hg increase in vacuum increases power output by 5.2 MW

Why This Matters: Plant operators can quantify the impact of environmental changes.       

B. Standard Errors (SE)

What: Uncertainty in our coefficient estimates
Interpretation:
- Small SE = precise estimate (reliable for decision-making)
- Large SE = uncertain estimate (risky for operational decisions)

C. t-values & p-values

What: Statistical significance tests
Power Plant Meaning:
- p < 0.05: This effect is real - not just random noise
- p > 0.05: This effect might be coincidental - don't base operations on it

Critical for Assignment: You must identify which factors reliably affect power output.    

D. R-squared (R²)

What: Percentage of power output variation explained by our model
Example: R² = 0.92 → Our model explains 92% of why power output varies
Business Impact: High R² means predictable operations - you can forecast output
reliably.

E. Adjusted R-squared

What: R² penalized for adding too many variables
Why Important: Prevents false complexity - ensures we're not adding useless variables     
just to boost R².

F. F-statistic & F p-value

What: Tests if the entire model is meaningful
Interpretation:
- High F, low p: The model as a whole is statistically valid
- Low F, high p: The model is useless - none of the variables matter

---
4. Multicollinearity Diagnostics (OLS-Specific)

A. VIF (Variance Inflation Factor)

What: Measures how much variables overlap in their information
Power Plant Example:
- VIF = 1: Independent - temperature tells us nothing about vacuum
- VIF = 5: Correlated - temperature and vacuum move together
- VIF > 10: Redundant - measuring almost the same thing

Operational Impact: High VIF means you can't isolate individual effects - dangerous       
for control decisions.

B. Condition Number

What: Numerical stability of the solution
Why Critical: High condition numbers mean unreliable coefficients - small data changes    
cause big coefficient changes.

---
5. Residual Diagnostics (Model Validity)

A. Jarque-Bera Test (Normality)

What: Tests if prediction errors are normally distributed
Power Plant Meaning:
- Normal residuals: Model captures the main patterns, only random noise remains
- Non-normal residuals: Model misses systematic patterns - there's hidden structure       

B. Breusch-Pagan Test (Heteroscedasticity)

What: Tests if prediction errors have constant variance
Operational Meaning:
- Homoscedastic: Model works equally well across all operating ranges
- Heteroscedastic: Model is unreliable in some operating conditions

C. Durbin-Watson Test (Autocorrelation)

What: Tests if prediction errors are independent
Time Series Context: In power plants, this catches time-dependent patterns the model      
missed.

6. Why This Matters for Power Plant Operations

Practical Applications:

1. Capacity Planning: "If temperature rises 5°C, we lose 73.5 MW capacity"
2. Efficiency Optimization: "Focus on vacuum control - biggest impact per unit effort"    
3. Predictive Maintenance: "High residuals indicate equipment degradation"
4. Economic Analysis: "Temperature effects cost $X per degree in lost revenue"

Statistical Reliability:

- High p-values: Don't make operational decisions based on this variable
- High VIF: Can't trust individual effects - need different variable set
- Failed residual tests: Model may be systematically wrong in some conditions

---
7. Assignment Success Criteria

Your OLS analysis must:

✅ Identify which variables reliably affect power output (p-values)
✅ Quantify the magnitude of each effect (coefficients)✅ Assess prediction 
reliability (R², residual tests)
✅ Check for statistical problems (VIF, condition number)
✅ Provide business interpretation - what does this mean for plant operations?

The key insight: OLS isn't just about fitting lines - it's about understanding the        
physics and economics of power generation through statistical evidence.
